üëãüèª Hi I'm Jia Ying

When I was 17, I took my first programming course - Let's Code. It is a basic Ruby programming course for students who have not had any programming experience. I discovered that I liked solving programming questions.

I had 2 main questions at the time: How were programming languages created? What can we do with programming languages? I went on to attend courses related to programming/computer science. I completed a degree in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore to get those questions answered, but the more I try to know, the more I realise what I do not know, so this is a continuous work in progress.

Some highlights of my university life include: specialising in software engineering and programming languages, joining the NUS Overseas College (NOC) Program, being a part of the founding team in Women in Tech @ NUS Computing.

When I'm not coding, I do some jewelry making and take badly-taken pictures of chickens in the streets. On the rare occassion, I blog in [Medium](https://medium.com/@chowjiaying211).
