I had 2 main questions at the time: How were programming languages created? What can we do with programming languages? I went on to attend courses related to programming/computer science. I completed a degree in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore to get those questions answered, but the more I try to know, the more I realise what I do not know, so this is a continuous work in progress.">

    <p>üëãüèª Hi I&rsquo;m Jia Ying</p>
<p>When I was 17, I took my first programming course - Let&rsquo;s Code. It is a basic Ruby programming course for students who have not had any programming experience. I discovered that I liked solving programming questions.</p>
<p>I had 2 main questions at the time: How were programming languages created? What can we do with programming languages? I went on to attend courses related to programming/computer science. I completed a degree in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore to get those questions answered, but the more I try to know, the more I realise what I do not know, so this is a continuous work in progress.</p>
<p>Some highlights of my university life include: specialising in software engineering and programming languages, joining the NUS Overseas College (NOC) Program, being a part of the founding team in Women in Tech @ NUS Computing.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not coding, I do some jewelry making and take badly-taken pictures of chickens in the streets. On the rare occassion, I blog in <a href="https://medium.com/@chowjiaying211">Medium</a>.</p>
